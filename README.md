# MusicMatch

MusicMatch is a high-fidelity prototype generated with [myBalsamiq](https://www.mybalsamiq.com/) with the intent of creating a social networking site that would enable musicians to be able to collaborate with each other remotely.  

The PDF file is the  main result of a semi-formal study in Usability Engineering including Human Computer Interfacing, User Experience, and User Interface design.
